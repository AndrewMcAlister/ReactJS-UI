# WeatherUI
The Weather UI Written in ReactJS
Uses most recent language syntax
Many advanced features
(doesn't quite work, very close)

Form appears on screen
You can type country, city
Submit
The state of the form is saved
Data is retrieved correctly as far as the API - I can see API supplied data correctly
The data does not display, an error must be occuring and its hard to find it.

I've learned a hell of a lot!
It expects API on port 8081
